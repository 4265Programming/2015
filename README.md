## About this repository

This repository is used to hold the code for FRC Team 4265's 2015 robot, Trix. It is writen solely in LabVIEW and as such, Github does not allow for viewing of the files online, however, they may be downloaded and viewed by anyone with LabVIEW. These files were writen with LabVIEW 2014 and the 2015 FRC toolkit. Most everything should port to newer version of Labview and the tool kit, though there is a chance future changes with the toolkit may cause a few incompatibilities. The code was also designed to be run on the FRC issued roboRIO. This code is considered open-source so other users in the community may download, view and use the code as they wish, however Team 4265 assumes no responibility for damages cause by inappropriately using this code on robots that are either ill-equiped in terms of sensors, or for new code added by those who download it. Feel free to contact us about any questions that you may have concerning how or why we have writen the code the way it was written. 

NOTE: To use any part of the Autonomous mode for this robot, the Driver Station AND the Robot code are both needed in order for it to function properly. Not using one or the other with cause the Auton scripts to not function properly.
